**Project Title:**  
Create a GitHub project that implements a Python Utility for Testuff API SDK

**Project Description:**  
We're seeking a developer to create an open-source GitHub Python project that uses the [Testuff Python SDK](https://github.com/TestuffAPI/python-testuff)  
and integrates with the [Testuff API](https://www.testuff.com/api/).  
The purposes of the project are:  
- To test the SDK and report any incorrect behaviors  
- To add small GitHub projects using the SDK that will serve as demonstration samples for the Testuff developer community  
- To show "how-to" guides for useful testing tasks, mainly focusing on automation  
- To build a collection of GitHub "how-to" projects  

**Preconditions:**  
- You should sign up at Testuff at [app.testuff.com](https://app.testuff.com) to get a valid user and password  
- Proficiency in Python is mandatory  
- A GitHub account is mandatory; you should run `pip install` to install the SDK  
- A LinkedIn account is mandatory, as it is a critical way to connect with the developer community  

**Project Purpose:**  
- The utility should demonstrate a real-world use case  
- The project should be useful for actual QA and automation teams  
- You may propose a different project, but it must first receive preliminary approval  

**Tasks List:**  

1. **Automation with Playwright:**  
   - Setup: Prepare Playwright Python scripts; upload them to a Testuff Test object and get the test ID  
   - GitHub Script:  
     - Get the test by its AUTOMATION_ID  
     - Run the script with Playwright (create two scenarios: one passed and one failed)  
     - Use the `/testone` API to report the automation results  
     - If passed: set the status to 'passed'  
     - If failed: set the status to 'failed', create a Defect with the reason, and link it to this Run  

2. **Same task with another open-source automation tool:**  
   Selenium, Appium, TestNG, Cypress, Robot Framework, JUnit, PyTest, Apache JMeter, Cucumber, Postman, Gauge, Watir, SoapUI, Ranorex, Shai  

3. **Import tests from another test management tool into Testuff, preserving the test hierarchy:**  
   - Setup: Subscribe to any test management tool that allows exporting test data to XML; create some tests with hierarchy  
   - GitHub Script:  
     - Parse the XML  
     - Upload the tests to Testuff, preserving the test hierarchy  

**Final Deliverables:**  
- A public GitHub repository with working code and a README explaining setup and usage  
- Reference in GitHub to the [Testuff Full API Docs](https://testuff.com/product/help/api/) for advanced documentation  
- Reference in GitHub to the [Testuff Python SDK on GitHub](https://github.com/TestuffAPI/python-testuff) for SDK details  
- Comments and inline documentation in your code  
- A LinkedIn post about your project (only after successful testing and approval)  
- Additional bonuses may be granted for genuine community engagement such as stars, forks, and organic mentions on GitHub or LinkedIn  
- Contributors may optionally promote the repo in relevant professional forums or communities (e.g., Stack Overflow, TechWell Hub, r/softwaretesting (Reddit), TestGuild, Dev.to, Club Ministry of Testing)
